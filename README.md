# Phantom Malware
This repo contains a copy of Phantom Malware PoC created by Tim Niklas Witte from his 2020 IEEE Access article '[Phantom Malware: Conceal Malicious Actions From Malware Detection Techniques by Imitating User Activity](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3021743)' (Open Access). Mr Witte has posted a [video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf08omKOoxY) of the paper on YouTube.

I came across the paper on HK and decided to explore the concept of obfuscating malicious behaviour by imitating user activity. It was an oppurtunity to learn more about C++ too. I have commented the code in this repo to go into further detail on its purpose (TODO).

## Description

A proof-of-concept (PoC) of a technique to hide malicious activity by imitating user keystrokes and using a second desktop on windows.

## Process

The PoC creates a text file without the users knowledge, appearing on the users desktop.

### Steps

1. An additional desktop is created
2. The Windows Explorer (WE) is opened on this new desktop
3. A command is inserted into a WE input box on the new desktop
4. The command is executed by sending corresponding Windows Messages

The victim will not see a window popup or CMD, as all actions are conducted on a concealed desktop

## Edits required

1. Change the USER in the file path on line 36
